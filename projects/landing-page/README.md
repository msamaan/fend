# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Student comments
This is a Udacity project for Front End Web Development Professional Track. It mainly focuses on Javascript.

Code in this project is soley developed by me without any reference to colleagues.

Javascript loops and event handles are the core of this project.
